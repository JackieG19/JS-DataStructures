# Basic Data Structure in JS


There are basically three types of data structures: 
- Stacks and Queues are array-like structures that differ only in how items are inserted and removed. 
- Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs are structures with nodes that keep references to other nodes. 
- Hash Tables depend on hash functions to save and locate data.
